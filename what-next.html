  <h3>What Next?</h3>

	<h5>How the story started</h5>


			<br>

	
	<p>I first met David through a school mining project, where he kindly volunteered to give my class a talk about the mining in St Just and Pendeen. His passion and knowledge immediately stood out, 
		and he offered to lead captivating workshops on World War I, a subject in which he is an expert. From there, he arranged music sessions for us at the local miners’ chapel, which became a place we
		visited often. We were always grateful for his time and generosity. Over time, we began writing to each other regularly, exchanging reflections and stories from David’s fascinating life. We affectionately 
		called this ongoing correspondence “The Witterings,” and it was through these rich conversations that the inspiration for the book began to take shape.</p>
		 

	<h5>About Simon Gokkes</h5>

	<br>

	<p>Simon Gokkes (Sim) was a gifted Dutch composer and conductor, known for his deep connection to Jewish liturgical and biblical themes. Born in Amsterdam in 1897, 
		his musical talent was recognized early, and by the age of fifteen, his compositions were already being performed in synagogue. He trained at the Amsterdam Conservatory 
		and went on to innovate within the world of choral music, founding the Amsterdamsche Korenschool in 1921 to breathe new life into traditional male choir singing. Though 
		many of his works were lost during the Second World War, his influence endures. Gokkes, along with his wife and children, was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943. 
	The author’s novel draws inspiration from the imagined life of Gokkes’ son, offering a poignant tribute to a family whose stories were nearly silenced by history</p>
