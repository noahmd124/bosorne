    <p>
    When Germany invades Holland in 1940, thirteen-year-old Samuel De Souza escapes the Nazis with a forged passport and is smuggled to England. Safe at first, he finds friendship, love, and guidance from Jannie, his mentor and protector. But grief, anger, and a growing sense of duty drive Sam to lie about his age and join the Royal Navy, taking a stand against the regime that threatens his people.

A story of love, courage, and resilience inspired by real events.

   <h1>How The Story Started</h1>
	 My late literary flowering was inspired by a friend, Jo Fitzgerald. I sent her a
lengthy email, at the end of which I apologised for ‘wittering on.’
Her ‘keep on wittering’ prompted a series of stories about people I’d met and
things I’ve done during my long life. These I happily emailed to Jo, knowing
she would keep them safe, and in relevant sections. One day some may appear.
Others are too libellous to publish!
Covid gave me the great gifts of time, peace and space. Witterings flourished,
and so did my first novel.
Samuel da Souza came into being when I misheard the story of what happened
to Jo’s Dutch Jewish relatives. The ‘stoomboot’ De Ruyter was launched when
she told me about a spooky night onboard one of the original River Lek paddle
boats. It was not until June 2024 that I learnt the truth, by which time my novel
was with the publishers

	  De Ruyter is a fictional paddle-ship operated by De Stoomboot Reederij op de
Lek, with frequent stops between Rotterdam and Culemborg. This transport
company ran paddle-ships from 1873 – 1948 when it switched to road transport.
She can carry up to 2,000 passengers though normally takes 1,200 – 1,500.
First class passengers had an elegant saloon aft, with a bar and table service.
Second class passengers had a buffet forward.
Pipes only could be smoked below, provided they were fitted with a cap to
prevent sparks flying out.
Cargo, carried on the forecastle, included cattle, horses and riders, cheese, flour,
milk, skins, beans and peas. Several of the crew could milk cows.
10 crew: Captain, helmsman, 2 deckhands

Engineer and fireman
2 conductors
Steward and 2 assistants

    <p>Out of the Depths takes the reader to London, Cornwall and Hampshire as it
follows the lives of Sam, his mentor, and others who sailed in De Ruyter. Each
of the three locations includes real houses that I have either visited or stayed in.
Most of what happens is fictional; most, but all.

    <h1>Researching</h1>

	  <br>
	  <br>
    
    <p>As I was writing during the lock-down imposed by Covid, I read widely and
watched a number of early films on YouTube about life on the stoomboots, and
in Rotterdam and London. I also found German maps and photographs showing
details of the assault on Rotterdam on 10 th May 1940.
Among the many books I bought online, none is more precious than the 1940
edition of Reed’s Nautical Almanac. Here I found tide times, times of sun and
moon rise and set, details about ports and much else that ensured accuracy in
the narrative.
When researching ship movements, I found that the Essex County Record
Office held correspondence and reports from Captain Mallory, master of the
LNER Harwich – Hook of Holland ferry Malines. Bless them for sending me
copies.
Wonder of wonders – I was able to read the weather reports for the crucial days
of my story. If the weather had been different, my story would not have been
written.
The German invasion of neutral Holland was brief, brutal and successful.
Reading accounts of the four days of heroic defence by the tiny Dutch air force,
their anti-aircraft gunners, army and marines made me think that the heavy loss
of German transport aircraft saved Britain from an assault by air soon after
Dunkirk.
Writing about a Jewish family required careful thought and detailed research.
Once I started writing, my characters rapidly came alive and welcomed me into
their homes and onboard their ship. What is written is an account of what I saw,
heard, smelt and experienced. I was living with those people, with the same
hopes and fears, the same doubts and certainties. All I had to do was write it
down.</p>
